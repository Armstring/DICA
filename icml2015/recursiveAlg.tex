\subsection{Recursive versions}

Recently \citet{vempala2014max} proposed an idea to improve the sample complexity of Fourier PCA algorithm \citep{goyal2014fourier}. 
The idea is that instead of recovering all the columns of $A$ in one eigen-decomposition, it only decompose the whole space into two sub-spaces, 
then recursively decompose each subspaces until it is 1-dimensional.
The insight of this recursive procedure is when the maximal spacing of the eigenvalues are much large than  the minimal one (e.g. improve from $\frac{\delta}{d^2}$ to $\frac{\delta}{\log d}$), then even the error may accumulated in the recursion, overall we still have better results. 



Note that this idea is general enough, and can be also applied to our algorithm, as follows.
