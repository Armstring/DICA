\begin{abstract}
We study independent component analysis with noisy observations. 
We present, for the first time in the literature, consistent, polynomial-time algorithms to recover non-Gaussian source signals and the mixing matrix with 
a reconstruction error that vanishes at a rate of $\sqrt{T}$ using $T$ observations and scales only polynomially with
the natural parameters of the problem. 
Our algorithms and analysis also extend to deterministic source signals whose empirical distributions are approximately independent.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Intro}
Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
%, as a main tool of blind source separation, 
has received much attention in the past decades. 
In the standard ICA model one can observe a $d$-dimensional vector $X$ that is a linear mixture of $d$ independent variables $(S_1,\ldots, S_d)$ with Gaussian noise:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stoch-ICA}
X = AS+\epsilon,
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ is a $d$-dimensional Gaussian noise with zero mean and covariance matrix $\Sigma$, and $A$ is a nonsingular $d \times d$ mixing matrix. The goal of the observer is to recover (separate) the source signals and the mixing matrix given several independent and identically distributed (\iid) observations from the above model.
The ICA literature is vast in both practical algorithms and theoretical analyses; 
we refer to the book of \citet{comon2010handbook} for a comprehensive survey.
% In particular, the ICA model can be viewed in a semiparametric manner with parameters $(W, p_1, \ldots, p_d)$ where $W$ is the targeted matrix, and nuisance parameters $p_i$ is the density function of the $i$-th source\footnote{Parametric perspective of the ICA model is also proposed in the literature \citep{pham1997blind,lee1999independent}, but it is beyond the scope of this paper.}. 
In this paper we investigate one of he most important problems in ICA: finding consistent, computationally efficient algorithms with finite-sample performance guarantees. In particular, we aim to develop algorithms whose computational and sample complexity are polynomial in the natural parameters of the problem.

% Our interest is proposing a `real' provable polynomial-time algorithm to reconstruct $A$ given observations of $X$.
% Formally, an algorithm is called a provable polynomial-time algorithm, if the algorithm takes data $D$ and a \emph{data independent} parameter $\alpha$ as its input, and output $A$ in a running time of  $O\left(\text{Poly}(|D|, \alpha)\right)$ with guarantee on its correctness, where $|D|$ is the size of the data $D$ and $\text{Poly}(\cdot)$ is a polynomial in its arguments. 
% If the parameter $\alpha$ has to be \emph{data dependent} to guarantee its correctness or polynomial running time, we call it oracle based algorithm, since it needs an oracle to propose the right $\alpha$. 
% \begin{remark}
% A trivial oracle based provable algorithm for the ICA problem could be taking the observations of $X$ and a matrix parameter $M$ as its input, and then outputting $M$. 
% If an oracle exists to propose the right matrix $M$ ($=A$), then the algorithm correctly outputs $A$ in constant time. 
% \end{remark}
% \begin{remark}
% SVM is a real provable polynomial-time algorithm. Even though in a classic analysis the error rate depends on its regularization coefficient $\lambda$, the result is valid for any $\lambda$, thus data independent. 
% %Different $\lambda$'s will incur different error rates.)
% \end{remark}

A popular approach to the ICA problem is to find a linear transformation $W$ for $X$ by optimizing a, so-called, \emph{contrast function} 
that measures dependence or non-gaussianity of the resulting coordinates of $WX$.
The optimal $W$ then can serve as an estimate of $A^{-1}$, thereby recovering the mixing matrix $A$.
One of the most popular ICA algorithms, FastICA \citep{hyvarinen1999fast},
follows this approach for a specific contrast function.  
FastICA has been analyzed theoretically from many aspects \citep{tichavsky2006performance,oja2006fastica,ollila2010deflation,dermoune2013fastica,wei2014convergence}.
%, however, to the best of our knowledge, no finite-sample bounds are available for the general noisy case.
In particular, recently \citet{miettinen2014fourth} showed  that in the noise-free case (i.e., when $X = AS$), the error of FastICA (when using a particular forth-moments-based contrast function) vanishes at a rate of $1/\sqrt{T}$ where $T$ is the sample size.
In addition, several other methods have been shown to achieve similar error rates in the noise-free setting \citep[e.g.,][]{eriksson2003characteristic,samarov2004nonparametric,chen2005consistent,chen2006efficient}.
However, to our knowledge, no similar finite sample results are available in the noisy case.
% The first  $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator of $A$ (which implies a finite sample bound in the rate of $\sqrt{n}$), to our best knowledge, is proposed and analyzed by \citet{samarov2004nonparametric}. 
% It is showed that the outer product of the density gradient as a matrix-valued functional has a diagonal structure in its expectation, 
% thereby an simultaneously diagonalizing two consistent estimators of such functionals will lead to a consistent estimation of $A$.
% Later other consistent estimators are also proposed \citep{eriksson2003characteristic,chen2005consistent,chen2006efficient}.
%%Later \citet{chen2005consistent} showed that the estimator 
%%based on characteristic functions of the joint probability of $S$ and the product of its 
%%proposed in \citet{eriksson2003characteristic} is also $\sqrt{n}$-consistent.
%Another estimator which is more efficient is also proposed by the same authors in \citep{chen2006efficient}.
% However, these results are all limited to a noiseless setting. 
% Moreover, they involve an intermediate procedure of estimating a probability function or a score function, which consequentially introduces extra technical conditions. 

On the other hand, several promising algorithms are available in the noisy case that make significant advances towards provably efficient and effective ICA algorithms, albeit fall short of providing a complete solution. 
Using a quasi-whitening procedure, \citet{arora2012provable} reduces the problem to finding all the local optima of a specific function defined using the forth order cumulant, 
and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find them with appealing theoretical guarantees. However, the results depend on an unspecified parameter ($\beta$ in the original paper) whose proper tuning is essential; note that even an exhaustive search over $\beta$ is problematic, since its valid range is not well understood.

% The first such method that can deal with the noise setting is attributed to \citet{arora2012provable}. 
% %The idea is still based on the forth moments. 
% After a quasi-whitening procedure, the ICA problem is reduced into a problem of finding all the local optima of a specific function defined using the forth order cumulant. 
% Then a polynomial-time algorithm is proposed to find them with theoretical guarantee.
% Despite its soundness in theory, this algorithm requires an exhaustive search for an input parameter ($\beta$ in the original paper), the valid range of which is not yet well understood. Thus, this algorithm is essentially an oracle based algorithm.
% %The definition of the so-called `real' provable algorithm will be proposed and discussed later in this section.

The exploitation of the special algebraic structure of the forth moments induced by the independence leads to several other works related to ICA \citep{hsu2013learning,anandkumar2012tensordecomposition,anandkumar2012method}. 
A similar idea is also discussed earlier as a intuitive argument to construct a contrast function \citep{cardoso1999high}. 
The first rigorous proofs for this idea are developed using matrix perturbation tools in a general tensor perspective \citep{anandkumar2012tensordecomposition,anandkumar2012method,goyal2014fourier}. 
A common problem faced by these methods is a minimal gap of the eigenvalues, which may result in an exponential dependence on the number of source signals $d$.
More precisely, these methods all require an eigen-decomposition of some flattened tensor where the minimal gap between the eigenvalues plays an essential role. 
Although the exact size of this gap is not yet understood, a naive analysis introduces an exponential dependence on the dimension $d$. 
Such dependence is also observed in the literature \citep{cardoso1999high,goyal2014fourier}.
One way to circumvent such dependence is to directly decompose a high-order tensor using the power method, which requires no flattening procedure \citep{anandkumar2014guaranteed}. 
However, when applied to the ICA problem, this introduces a bias term and so the error does not approach 0 as the sample size approaches infinity.
Another issue is the well-known fact that the power method is unstable in practice for high-order tensors. 
\citet{goyal2014fourier} proposed another method by exploring the characteristic function rather than the forth moments.
However, their algorithm requires picking a parameter ($\sigma$ in the original paper) that is smaller than some unknown quantity, making their algorithm impossible to tune.
%Also, estimating the derivative tensor of the second cumulant generating function requires estimating a number of high-order tensors in the complex plane. %\todoa{And then what?}
%to balance the running time and the correctness
Recently, \citet{vempala2014max} proposed an ICA algorithm based on an elegant, recursive version of the method of \citet{goyal2014fourier} that avoids dealing with the aforementioned minimal gap; however, they still need an oracle to set the unspecified parameter of \citet{goyal2014fourier}.

In this paper we propose a \emph{provably polynomial-time} algorithm for the noisy ICA model.
%a practical method for ICA which also has meaningful theoretical guarantee (polynomial-time; no need of parameter tuning; with high probability the reconstruction error of $A$ polynomially depends on all the parameters; and the reconstruction error vanishes as the sample size going to infinity).
Our algorithm is a refined version of the ICA method proposed by \cite{hsu2013learning} (HKICA). 
However, we propose two simpler ways, one inspired by \citet{frieze1996learning}, \citet{arora2012provable}, and another based on \citet{vempala2014max}, to deal with the spacing problem of the eigenvalues under similar conditions to those of \citet{goyal2014fourier}.
Unlike the method proposed by \citet{goyal2014fourier}, our first method can force the eigenvalues to be well-separated with a gap that is independent of the mixing matrix $A$, while our second method, based on the recursive decomposition idea of \citet{vempala2014max}, avoids dealing with the minimum gap (on the price of introducing other complications).
We prove that our methods achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ error in estimating $A$ and the source signals, with high probability, such that both the convergence rate and the computational complexity scale \emph{polynomially} with the natural parameters of the problem. %  is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent.
Our method needs no parameter tuning, which makes it even more appealing. %a \emph{real} provable algorithm.  


Another contribution of the present paper is that our analysis is conducted in a deterministic manner. 
In practice, ICA is also known to work well for unmixing the mixture of various deterministic signals. 
One of the classical demonstrations of ICA is showing that two periodic signals can be well recovered from their mixtures \citep{HyvOja00}.
Such an example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:demo}. It can be seen that our algorithm, DICA, designed for deterministic signals, can solve he problem better than
other algorithms, FastICA \citep{hyvarinen1999fast} and HKICA \citep{hsu2013learning}.

\begin{figure}[pt]
\label{fig:demo}
\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{demo}
\caption{Example of ICA for deterministic sources: The first two rows show the source signals $s_1(t)=\lfloor t-2\lfloor t/2 \rfloor \rfloor-0.5$, $s_2=\cos(t)$, the next two rows present the observations with mixing matrix matrix $A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}1&-2\\2.6&1.3\end{array}\right)$. The reconstructed (and rescaled) signals are shown for FastICA, HKICA, and DICA after sampling $s(t)$ at 10000 uniformly spaced points in the interval $[0,15]$.}
\end{figure}

Such phenomenon suggests that the usual probabilistic notion is unsatisfactory if one wishes to have deeper understanding of ICA.   
Our deterministic analysis helps investigate this curious phenomenon without losing any generality to the traditional stochastic setting. Formally, instead of observing $T$ \iid samples from \eqref{eq:stoch-ICA}, the source signals are defined by the function $s:\natural \ra \real^d$ be a $d$-dimensional deterministic ``signal'', and
the observations are $x(t)=A s(t) +\epsilon_t$, where $(\epsilon_t)_{t=1}^\infty$ is an \iid sequence of $d$-dimensional $\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ random variables.

% Denote by $s_i$ the $i$th component of $s$.
% We present the ICA model as a linear mixture of functions (details will be introduced later).
% Then we analyze the HKICA algorithm \citep{hsu2013learning} under this presentation using a measure of functional dependence.
% A detailed analysis shows that its performance depends on the minimal gap of the eigenvalues (of some random matrix. The exact form is presented later.).
% A key step of our algorithm is reducing such minimal eigenvalue gap problem to the problem of minimal spacing of i.i.d. Cauchy random variables by the quasi-whitening procedure, for which a polynomial lower bound is available.
% With this lower bound, we then show the new algorithm has provable guarantee on the reconstruction error of $A$. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: 
The problem and the main results are introduced in Section~\ref{sec:Preliminaries}.
Then our polynomial-time algorithms are developed through the next two sections: Section~\ref{sec:AnalysisHK} is devoted to the analysis of the HKICA algorithm, while our new algorithms are presented in Section~\ref{sec:DICA}.
Experimental results are reported in Section \ref{sec:ExpRes}.
All proofs are provided in the appendix.

\subsection{Notation}
All vectors, matrices and tensors are real or complex valued, unless otherwise stated; below $K$ denotes either the set of real or complex numbers. We denote the set of real and natural numbers by $\real$ and $\natural$, respectively.
A vector $v \in K^d$ is assumed to be a column vector.
Let $\|v\|_2$ denote its $L_2$-norm, and for any matrix $A$ let $\|A\|_2=\max_{v:\|v\|_2=1}{\|A v\|_2}$ denote the corresponding induced norm. Denote the maximal and minimal singular value of $A$ by $\sigma_{\max}(A)$ and  $\sigma_{\min}(A)$, respectively. Also, let $A_i$ and $A_{i:}$ denote the $i$th column and, resp., row of $A$, and let $A_{(2,\min)} = \min_{i} \|A_i\|_2$, $A_{(2,\max)} = \max_{i} \|A_i\|_2$ and $A_{\max} = \max_{i,j} |A_{i,j}|$. 
Clearly, $\sigma_{\max}(A) =\|A\|_2 \ge A_{(2,\max)} \ge A_{\max}$, and $\sigma_{\min}(A) \le A_{(2,\min)}$. For a tensor (including vectors and matrices) $T$, its Frobenious norm (or $L_2$ norm) $\|T\|_F$  is defined as the square root of the sum of the square of all the entries.  
For a vector $v=(v_1,\ldots,v_d) \in K^d$, $\vert v \vert$ is defined coordinatewise, that is $\vert v \vert=(\vert v_1 \vert,\ldots,\vert v_d\vert)$. 
The transpose of a vector/matrix $A$ is denoted by $A^\top$, while the inverse of the transpose is denoted by $A^{-\top}$. 
The outer product of two vectors $v, u \in K^d$ is denoted by $u\otimes v=u v^\top$. 
$v^{\otimes k}$ denotes the $k$-fold outer product of $v$ with itself, that is, $v\otimes v\otimes v \ldots \otimes v$, which is a k-dimensional tensor.
Given a $4$-dimensional tensor $T$, we denote the matrix $M$ by $T(\eta,\eta,\cdot , \cdot)$ that is generated by marginalizing the first two coordinates of $T$ on the direction $\eta$, that is,
$M_{i,j} = \sum_{k_1,k_2 = 1}^{d} \eta_{k_1} \eta_{k_2} T_{k_1,k_2,i,j}$. (Similar definitions for marginalizing different coordinates of the tensor.)
For a real vector $v$ and some real number $C$, $v \le C$ means that all the entries of $v$ are at most $C$. 
The bold symbol $\boldsymbol{1}$ denotes a vector with all entries being $1$ (the dimension of this vector will always be clear from the context).




\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:Preliminaries}
In this section we introduce the ICA problem without the usual stochastic i.i.d.  assumptions on the source signal.
As preliminaries, we introduce the induced probability measures by the signal, which is a generalization of empirical 
frequency counts.
\subsection{Induced Probability}
\label{subsec:InducesProb}
Let  $(\mu_t)_{t\ge0}$ be a sequence of probability measures over some measurable domain $(\Omega,\AA)$, 
and $s: \Omega \ra \real^d$. Then,  for any function and $t\ge 0$, the probability measure $\nu_t$ over $\real^d$ induced by $s$ and $\mu_t$ is defined as
\[
\nu_t(B)= \mu_t\Bigl( \cset{z}{s(z)\in B} \Bigr)
= \mu_t ( s^{-1}(B) ).
\]
for any Borel set $B\subset \real^d$.
Note that if $\Omega = \natural$, $\AA = 2^\natural$ and $\mu_t$ is
the uniform distribution on $\{0,\ldots,t\}$, then $\nu_t$ is the
empirical distribution of $s(1),\ldots,s(t)$. 

For continuous time observations, one can select $\Omega=\R$, $\AA$ as the Borel sets over $\R$, and $\mu_t$ as the uniform distribution on $[0,t]$; then $\nu_t$ is the empirical distribution of $s(\tau), \tau \in [0,t]$.

In what follows we fix $\Omega$ and $(\mu_t)$ and define all the concepts that follow relative to these. 
In this paper we only consider about real functions. If we want to emphasize the dependence on $s$ then we will use $\nu_t^{(s)}$.
\if0
When the limit of $(\nu_t)$ exists, it will be denoted by $\nu$.
Also, if we want to emphasize the dependence on $s$ then we will use $\nu^{(s)}$.
Similarly, when the dependence of $\nu_t$ on $s$ is important, we will use $\nu^{(s)}_t$.
\begin{definition}
A function $s:\Omega \rightarrow \real^d$ is called \emph{ergodic} w.r.t. $(\mu_t)_{t\ge0}$
if the sequence of  induced probability measures $(\nu_t)_{t\ge 0}$ is weakly convergent.
\end{definition}
A simple example of an ergodic function is a real periodic function.
The following lemma shows that once $\nu$ exists, it is a probability measure. 
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:ergodicfunction}
Let $\scom{i}$ denote the $i$th coordinate function of $s$. Assume that
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty} \int |\scom{i}(x)|\, d\mu_t(x) 
\]
exists and is finite for all $1 \le i \le d$ and that $\esssup_{\mu_t} |\scom{i}|<\infty$ for any $1\le i \le d$ and $t\ge 0$.
Then all limit points of the sequence $\{\nu_t\}$, with respect to the weak topology, are probability measures over $\real^d$.
\end{prop}
\fi

\subsection{The ICA Problem}
\label{subsec:ICA}
Assume we are given a $d$-dimensional observed function $x(t)$ for $0\le t \le T$ generated by  
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:ICA}
x(t) = As(t)+\epsilon(t), \quad 0\le  t\le T
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a $d\times d$ nonsingular mixing matrix,  $s$ is a $d$-dimensional deterministic source function, and $\epsilon$ is the noise function. 

We assume the infinity norm of $s_i$, the $i$th component of the function $s$, is bounded by a constant $C\ge 1$.
Moreover, we assume there exists a constant $L\ge 1$, such that 
\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\vspace{-3mm}
\item $\| \E_{X\sim \nu_t^{(s_i)}} [X] \|_F\le L/\sqrt{t}$;
\item $\| \E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y] \|_F \le L/\sqrt{t}$;
\item $\| \E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes 2}] \|_F \le L$;
\item $\| \E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes 3}] \|_F \le L$;
\item $\| \left(\E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes4}] - (\E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes2}])^{\otimes 2}\right)(\eta,\eta,\cdot,\cdot)  - 2 (\E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes2}])^{\otimes 2}(\eta,\cdot,\eta,\cdot)\|_F\le L/\sqrt{t}\|\eta\|_2^2$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{remark}
The first two statements force the average of $s$ and $\epsilon$ decay to 0 in a rate of $\sqrt{n}$.
The next two assumptions require both second and third moments are bounded.
The last assumption is basically saying the induced measure of the noise function $\epsilon$ has 0 kurtosis in the limit.
All these assumptions about $\epsilon$ will be satisfied by i.i.d Gaussian noise $\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)$ with fixed $\Sigma$, as proved later in Proposition~\ref{prop:stochasticAss}.
\end{remark}
Moreover, we only assume the source signal function and the noise function are `independent' up to the 4th moment in the sense that for $i_1,i_2,j_1,j_2 \ge 0$ that $i_1+i_2+j_1+j_2 \le 4$,  
\begin{align*}
& \| \E_{X\sim \nu_t^{(s)}} [(AX)^{\otimes i_1}\otimes \E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes j_1}] \otimes (AX)^{\otimes i_2}]\\
& \quad - \E_{(X, Y)\sim \nu_t^{(s, \epsilon)}} [(AX)^{\otimes i_1}\otimes Y^{\otimes j_1}\otimes (AX)^{\otimes i_2}]  \|_F \\
& \le L/\sqrt{t},
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
& \| \E_{Y\sim \nu_t^{(\epsilon)}} [Y^{\otimes j_1} \otimes \E_{X\sim \nu_t^{(s)}} [(AX)^{\otimes i_1}] \otimes Y^{\otimes j_2}] \\
& \quad - \E_{(X, Y)\sim \nu_t^{(s, \epsilon)}} [ Y^{\otimes j_1}\otimes (AX)^{\otimes i_1}\otimes Y^{\otimes j_2}] \|_F \\
& \le L/\sqrt{t},
\end{align*}
 where $(s,\epsilon)$ is the function by concatenating $s$ and $\epsilon$ together.  
The sufficiency of such weaker assumption is also discussed in the paper of \citet{frieze1996learning}.
Similarly, we will prove that this assumption does not lose any generality to the traditional stochastic setting of the ICA model with Gaussian noise independent to the source signals, in Proposition~\ref{prop:stochasticAss}. 
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:stochasticAss}
In the traditional stochastic setting of ICA, there exists $L = \text{Poly}(A_{\max}, \|\Sigma\|_2, C, d,\frac{1}{\delta})$, such that with probability at least $1-\delta$, all the assumptions above hold .
\end{prop}
On the other hand, our setting can also cover some other examples excluded by the traditional setting. One of such examples is the example \ref{eg:1} in the Introduction. We present its general form here.
\begin{example}
Assume that each unknown sources $s_i$s ($1\le i\le d$) are deterministic and periodic. Our observation $x=As+\eps$ is a linear mixture of $s$ contaminated by an i.i.d Gaussian noise for each time step, where $A$ is a non-singular matrix and $\eps\sim {\cN}(0,\Sigma)$ is Gaussian noise.   
Even though $\eps$ is i.i.d. for every time step, the observations can not satisfy the traditional i.i.d. assumption, since the source $s$ is deterministic. However, it can be proved that if the ratio of the periods of each pair of $(s_i, s_j)$ is irrational, then this example satisfies all the assumptions above, given large enough $T$.   
\end{example}
Another example is a source with both deterministic component and stochastic component, as follows.
\begin{example}
Assume the source signal has two dimensions, $s_1$ and $s_2$. For discrete time step $t = 1,2,\ldots$, assume $s_1$ is a deterministic signal with period $p$, i.e. $s_1(p+t) = s_1(t)$. 
Also assume $s_2$ is generated from some distribution $P$ independently to $s_1$ and time step $t$.
Our observation $x=As+\eps$ is a linear mixture of $s$ contaminated by an i.i.d Gaussian noise for each time step, where $A$ is a non-singular matrix and $\eps\sim {\cN}(0,\Sigma)$ is Gaussian noise.   
Similarly, the observations can not satisfy the traditional i.i.d. assumption, since the source $s$ is deterministic. 
However, this example satisfies all the assumptions above, given large enough $T$.   
\end{example}

\subsection{Quasi-Whitening}
\label{subsec:quasiwhite}
For $p\ge 1$, $\eta\in \real^d$, 
let 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:momnent}
m_p^{(\nu)}(\eta) = \E_{Y\sim \nu}[ (\eta^\top Y)^p ]
\end{equation}
and let
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:funcf}
f_{\nu}(\eta) = \frac1{12} \left( m_4^{(\nu)}(\eta) - 3 m_2^{(\nu)}(\eta)^2 \right)\,.
\end{equation}
Our algorithm will heavily explore the second derivative of the function $f_{\nu_T^{(x)}}$. 
Note that $\nabla^2f_{\nu}(\eta)$  can be evaluated by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:G}
\nabla^2 f_{\nu}(\eta) = G_{\nu}(\eta):= G_1^{(\nu)}(\eta) - G_2^{(\nu)}(\eta) -2G_3^{(\nu)}(\eta),
\end{equation}
where 
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{align*}
& G_1^{(\nu)}(\eta) =  \E_{X\sim \nu} [\big(\eta^{\top}X\big)^2XX^{\top}]; \\
& G_2^{(\nu)}(\eta) = \E_{X\sim \nu} [\big(\eta^{\top}X\big)^2] \E_{X\sim \nu} [XX^{\top}]; \\
%\frac{1}{T^2}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \big(\eta^{\top}x(t)\big)^2 \sum_{t=1}^{T}x(t)x(t)^{\top}; \\
& G_3^{(\nu)}(\eta) = \E_{X\sim \nu} [\big(\eta^{\top}X\big)X] \E_{X\sim \nu} [\big(\eta^{\top}X\big)X^{\top}].
%\frac{1}{T^2}\Big(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \big(\eta^{\top}x(t)\big)x(t)\Big) \Big(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \big(\eta^{\top}x(t)\big)x(t)\Big)^{\top}.
\end{align*} 
In particular, we will prove that the function $\nabla^2f$ is robust to noise, as follows. 
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:denoise}
For any vector $\eta$ satisfying $\|\eta\|_2\le L_{\eta}$,
\[
\| \nabla^2f_{\nu_T^{(x)}}(\eta) - \nabla^2f_{\nu_T^{(As)}}(\eta) \|_2 \le \frac{\text{Poly}(L_{\eta}, L, d, \sigma_{\max}(A), C)}{\sqrt{T}}. 
\] 
\end{prop}  
Denote $\frac{\text{Poly}(L_{\eta}, L, d, \sigma_{\max}(A), C)}{\sqrt{T}}$ by $P(L_{\eta})$. Note that this error caused by noise will decay in a rate of $\sqrt{t}$.
For simplicity, we would assume that $\mu_t$ is the uniform distribution over $\{1,2,\ldots, t\}$ for the rest of the paper.
All the results can be easily extended to a general $\mu_t$ by replacing the average by empirical mean. 
%We also assume that $T$ is large enough such that $P\le 1/6$.

\if0
Note that the above deterministic setting does not lose any generality to the traditional stochastic setting of ICA with Gaussian noise, given that we can rewrite the stochastic setting as 
\[
x = As+\eps = A(s+A^{-1}\eps),
\] 
where $\eps$ is a Gaussian noise. In practice, we are not going to observe the true distribution of $x$, but $x(t)$, $t\ge 0$, which leads to Equation \eqref{equ:ICA}.

\section{Analysis of the HKICA Algorithm}
\label{sec:AnalysisHK}
Even though \citet{hsu2013learning} believed that the HKICA algorithm has provable guarantee, no rigorous analysis is provided. 
We try to fill the gap in the next section. 
A detailed analysis shows that the performance of the algorithm may not be as trivial as it is claimed.

\subsection{the HKICA algorithm}
\label{subsec:HKalg}
The HKICA algorithm is proposed based on the idea of moment methods, as shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:HKICA}. 
We use  $\hat{f}$  as an abbreviation of $f_{\nu_T^{(x)}}$ for simplicity.
In general, we denote by adding a ``hat'' on the top of a symbol its empirical estimate w.r.t. $\nu_T^{(x)}$. A un-hatted notion is estimated w.r.t. some product measure $\mu$. 
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{the HKICA algorithm}
\label{alg:HKICA}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\INPUT $x(t)$ for $1\le t \le T$. 
\OUTPUT An estimation of the mixing matrix $A$. 
\STATE Sample $\phi$ and $\psi$ independently from a standard Gaussian distribution of dimension $d$;
\STATE Evaluate $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\phi)$ and $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)$, 
\STATE Compute $\hat{M} = (\nabla^2 \hat{f}(\phi))(\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi))^{-1}$;
\STATE Compute all the eigenvectors of $\hat{M}$, $\{\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d\}$;
\STATE Return $\hat{A} = (\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d)$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{remark}[Remark for Algorithm \ref{alg:HKICA}]
\label{rmk:symmetrization}
Let $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi) =\hat{B}\hat{B}^{\top} $.
In practice, the HKICA algorithm may generate complex output. 
This occurs only when $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)$ is singular. 
Otherwise, the eigenvalues of $\hat{M}$ would be the same as those of
$\hat{B}^{-\top}\nabla^2 \hat{f}(\phi)\hat{B}^{-1}$ which is symmetric and thus has all real eigenvalues, where $\hat{B} $ is the square root of $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)$. 
Note that theoretically the singularity of $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)$ happens with probability 0. 
One way of fixing this problem is re-sampling $\phi$ and $\psi$ until a real eigen-decomposition exists.

Another possible way, avoiding re-sampling albeit with larger error, is by a symmetrizing trick.
Instead of computing $\hat{M} = (\nabla^2 \hat{f}(\phi))(\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi))^{-1}$, one can calculate the eigen-decomposition of  $\hat{B}^{-\top}\nabla^2 \hat{f}(\phi)\hat{B}^{-1}$. 
Note that $\hat{B} \approxeq ADR^{\top}$ for some diagonal matrix $D$ and orthonormal matrix $R$. 
Hence such eigen-decomposition will recover $\hat{R}\approxeq R$. 
Then $A$ can be reconstructed, up to permutation and scaling of columns, by $\hat{A} = \hat{B}\hat{R}$.
As mentioned above, $ \hat{B}^{-\top}\nabla^2 \hat{f}(\phi)\hat{B}^{-1}$ is always symmetric, thus yields a real eigen-decomposition. 
Theoretical analysis of the symmetrizing version of the algorithm would require more steps but similar ideas go through. We omit its analysis in the paper.
\qed
\end{remark}

\subsection{Reconstruction error}
\label{subsec:errorHK}
Our analysis is developed in a deterministic setting.
We try to have weaker assumption instead of assuming independent observations and independent signals for the source function. 
Clearly, no meaningful results will be achieved if $s$ is allowed to go arbitrarily wild. 
 
In what follows in this paper, we fix $\mu = \mu_1\otimes \ldots \otimes \mu_d$ as some product measure
satisfying $\E_{Y\sim\mu_i}[Y]=0$ and $\kappa_i := \vert \E_{Y\sim \mu_i}[Y^4] - 3\left(\E_{Y\sim \mu_i}[Y^2]\right)^2 \vert \neq 0$.
Denote the diagonal matrix $\text{diag}(\kappa_1,\cdots,\kappa_d)$ by $K$. 
Also, denote $\max_{i} \kappa_i$ by $\kappa_{\max}$ and $\min_{i} \kappa_i$ by $\kappa_{\min}$.
We define a `distance' for two distributions, as follows. 
\begin{definition}
Given two distributions $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$, let $D_k(\nu_1,\nu_2) = \sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}} |\int f(x)d\nu_1(x) - \int f(x)d\nu_2(x)|$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all monomials up to degree $k$.
\end{definition} 
Let 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:xi}
\xi = \left( 6C^2D_2(\mu, \nu_T^{(s)}) + D_4(\mu, \nu_T^{(s)})\right),
\end{equation}
which serves as a measure of how dependent the  component signals of $s$ are.

\begin{remark}
\label{rmk:xi}
In general, we will need a condition that $\xi$ is small enough, so that the components of $s$ are 'independent' enough.
In the traditional stochastic setting where the observations are i.i.d samples, the empirical distribution will weakly converge to the popular distribution which, based on the independence assumption, is a product probability measure. 
Therefore, this condition will be satisfied given large enough sample size. \qed
\end{remark} 

\begin{definition}
We denote by $\Epsi$ the following event: For some fixed $C_1 = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}A_{(2,\min)}}{\sqrt{2}d} \ell$ for $0\le \ell\le 1$, and $ L_u = \sqrt{2}\left(x^{1/2}+\sqrt{d}\right)$ for $x>0$,
\[\min_i |\psi^{\top}A_i| \ge C_1, \text{ and } \|\psi\|_2 \le L_u.\] 
\end{definition}
The following lemma provides a lower bound for $\min_i |\psi^{\top}A_i|$.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:dmin}
With probability at least $\left(1- \frac{\ell}{d}\right)\exp(-\ell) - \exp(-x)$, $\Epsi$ holds.
\end{lemma}
Let 
\begin{equation}
\label{def:kappa}
\gamma_A =  \min_{i,j: i\neq j} \left\vert \left(\frac{\phi^{\top}A_i}{\psi^{\top}A_i}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\phi^{\top}A_j}{\psi^{\top}A_j}\right)^2 \right\vert. 
\end{equation}
The performance of the HKICA algorithm will essentially depend on this parameters, as shown in the following theorem.
\begin{thm}
 \label{thm:efficiency} 
Given a large enough 
\begin{align*}
T & \ge \text{Poly}(d, L_u, C, \sigma_{\max}(A),\kappa_{\max}, L,\\
& \quad  1/\ell, 1/\kappa_{\min}, 1/\sigma_{\min}(A), 1/\gamma_A),
\end{align*}
assume that there exist a product measure $\mu$ such that 
\[\xi \le \text{Poly}(\gamma_A, \frac{1}{d}, \frac{1}{L_u}, \frac{1}{\sigma_{\max}(A)}, \frac{1}{\kappa_{\max}}, \kappa_{\min}, \sigma_{\min}(A), \ell),\] 
is small enough.
 Then on the event $\Epsi$, there exists a permutation $\pi$ and constants $\{c_1,\ldots,c_d\}$, such that for any $k$,
 \[
  \max_{1\le k\le d}\| c_1\hat{A}_{\pi(k)} - A_k\|_2 \le
  % \frac{4}{\gamma_A} \frac{\sigma_{\max}^2(A)}{ \sigma_{\min}(A)}Q,
  \frac{1}{\gamma_A} (\xi + P(L_u))Q
\]
where $\hat{A}$ is the output of the HKICA algorithm, and 
\[Q=\text{Poly}(d, L_u, \sigma_{\max}(A), \kappa_{\max}, \frac{1}{\kappa_{\min}}, \frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}(A)}, \frac{1}{\ell}).\]
 \end{thm}
 \if0
\begin{remark}
Note that the first condition holds with probability 1. Also, the other three conditions will be satisfied when $\xi$ is small enough (for a fixed $\gamma_A$).
In particular, as mentioned in the Remark \ref{rmk:xi}, these conditions will be satisfied in the traditional stochastic setting of ICA (for a fixed $\gamma_A$), given large enough sample size. \qed
%However, condition 2 and 3 are rarely satisfied in practice. 
%More discussion about this problem and weaker conditions are discussed in Section \ref{sec:ExpRes}. 
\end{remark}
\fi
\begin{remark}
The parameter $1/\gamma_A$ is essential in the above theorem, in the sense that not only the reconstruction error bound is linear in $1/\gamma_A$, but the conditionalso require a small $1/\gamma_A$ so that the above error bound is valid.

Note that $\gamma_A$ is actually the minimal gap of the eigenvalues of $M = (\nabla^2 f(\phi))(\nabla^2f(\psi))^{-1}$.
We would like to claim that such dependence on the minimal gap of the eigenvalues is necessary.
Consider a $2\times 2$ matrix $A = \text{diag}([a,b])$ where $a<b$. Let $\eps = b-a$. Note that two eigenvectors of $A$ are $[1,0]$ and $[0,1]$, and $\eps$ is the gap of its eigenvalues. If the perturbation is small, one can prove, as in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:efficiency}, that the variation of the eigenvectors is also small. 
However, if the perturbation is larger than the gap of the eigenvalues, i.e. $\eps$, then the variation of the eigenvectors could be arbitrary bad. To see this, consider perturbing $A$ by a matrix $E = \text{diag}([\eps,0])$. Thus $\hat{A} = \text{[b,b]}$ whose eigenvectors could be arbitrary orthogonal vectors, thus arbitrary  far away from $[1,0]$ and $[0,1]$ (the eigenvectors of $A$).   
Such discontinuity of the eigen-spaces suggests that the dependence on $\gamma_A$ is necessary for the HKICA algorithm because of the eigen-decomposition of $M$. 

Despite the important role that $\gamma_A$ plays in the efficiency of the HKICA algorithm, we have no clue about its behavior. 
Even a polynomial (in the dimension $d$) lower bound of $\gamma_A$ is not yet available, to our best knowledge, in the literature (This problem has been discussed by \citet{husler1987minimal}, but the result there does not apply to our case).
A delicate analysis carried out by \citet{goyal2014fourier} for a similar spacing problem is heavily based on the boundedness of the characteristic function, which isn't applicable here neither. 

This problem motivates us to refine the HKICA algorithm.
The idea is inspired by \citet{arora2012provable} and \citet{frieze1996learning} using a quasi-whitening procedure, as shown in the next section. \qed
\end{remark}
\section{A Refined HKICA Algorithm}
\label{sec:DICA}
Recall that $\hat{G}$ is defined in Equation \eqref{eq:G}.
Our new algorithm, named as Determined ICA (DICA), is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:DICA}. 
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Determined ICA (DICA)}
\label{alg:DICA}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\INPUT $x(t)$ for $1\le t \le T$. 
\OUTPUT An estimation of the mixing matrix $A$. 
\STATE Sample $\psi$ from a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution;
\STATE Evaluate $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)$, \\
%\quad where $\hat{m_p}(\eta) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^{T} (\eta^{\top}g(k))^p$, and $\hat{f}(\eta) = \frac{1}{12}\big(\hat{m_4}(\eta) - 3\hat{m_2}(\eta)^2 \big)$;
\STATE Compute $\hat{B}$ such that $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi) = \hat{B}\hat{B}^{\top}$;
\STATE Sample $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ independently from the standard Gaussian distribution;
\STATE Compute $\hat{T}_1 =\nabla^2\hat{f}(\hat{B}^{-\top}\phi_1)$ and  $\hat{T}_2 =\nabla^2\hat{f}(\hat{B}^{-\top}\phi_2)$;

\STATE Compute all the eigenvectors of $\hat{M} = \hat{T}_1\left(\hat{T}_2\right)^{-1}$, $\{\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d\}$;
\STATE Return $\hat{A} = \{\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d\}$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{remark}[Remark for Algorithm \ref{alg:DICA}]
The difficult in analyzing $\gamma_A$ of the HKICA algorithm is due to its dependence on the unknown mixing matrix $A$. 
The way of DICA to deal with this problem can be viewed in a tensor perspective. 
Instead of flattening two $4$-dimensional tensors into matrices simply by marginalizing in a random direction, in DICA we marginalize in a structured direction as $\psi^{\top}A^{-1}$ for a random $\psi$. 
Another possible interpretation could be in a  probabilistic perspective, as sampling $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ based on an estimation of the variance matrix. 
In particular, we would like to sample $\phi$ from a Gaussian distribution $\cN$$(0,V)$ where $V = A^{-\top}A^{-1}$, so that $\{\phi^{\top}A_1, \ldots, \phi^{\top}A_d \}$ is independent and hence $\gamma_A$ could be easier to analyze. 
Despite the true value of $A^{-\top}A^{-1}$ is not available, we can estimate it by $\left(\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)\right)^{-1}$ up to permutation and scaling,
which can still maintain the independence of $\{\phi^{\top}A_1, \ldots, \phi^{\top}A_d \}$). 
%Then in DICA, $\hat{B}^{-\top}\phi$ is a way of sampling such direction $v$.
%This perspective also suggest that a better estimation of $A^{-\top}A^{-1}$ would help improve DICA. 
\qed
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
Similarly, the DICA algorithm also suffers the complex output. 
A same symmetrizing trick can be applied again, as in Remark \ref{rmk:symmetrization}. \qed 
\end{remark}

The DICA algorithm can be showed to have provable performance under some good events defined as follows:
\begin{definition}
We denote by $\Ephi$ the following event:
For some fixed constant $L_u$ and $\ell_l$ such that $\ell_l = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{2}d}\ell$ for $0\le \ell\le 1$ and $ L_u = \sqrt{2}\left(x^{1/2}+\sqrt{d}\right)$ for $x>0$,
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item $\|\phi_1\|_2 \le L_u$;
\item $\|\phi_2\|_2 \le L_u$, and $\min_i \{|\phi_2^{\top}R_i|\} \ge \ell_l$ where $R_i$ is the $i$th column of some orthonormal matrix $R$ (specified in the Appendix);
\end{itemize} 
\end{definition}  
%Note that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are sampled independently from standard normal distribution. 
Note that on the event $\Ephi$, $\|\phi_j^{\top}R\|_2\le L_u$, $j\in\{1,2\}$. 
We will show later that this event $\Ephi$, as well as other events defined later, will hold simultaneously with high probability.
Let 
\begin{align*}
& \bar{\xi} =   \frac{\sqrt{2}d\left(L_u^2d^5 A_{(2,\max)}^2A_{\max}^2\xi + P\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}\ell^2\kappa_{\min}A^2_{(2,\min)}\sigma_{\min}^2(A)}, \\
& \hat{\xi} = \frac{3L_u^2d^5A^2_{\max}}{2\kappa_{\min}C_1^2}\xi + \frac{\sqrt{6}L_u^2\sigma_{\max}^2(A)}{C_1^2}\bar{\xi},
\end{align*} 
and 
\begin{equation}
\label{def:gammaR}
\gamma_R =  \min_{i,j: i\neq j} \left\vert \left(\frac{\phi_1^{\top}R_i}{\phi_2^{\top}R_i}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\phi_1^{\top}R_j}{\phi_2^{\top}R_j}\right)^2 \right\vert, 
\end{equation}
for the same orthonormal matrix $R$ in the event $\Ephi$.
%Similar to Lemma~\ref{lem:dmin}, on the event $\Ephi$ with probability at least $1/4$, $\text{min}_i |\phi_1^{\top}R_i| \ge \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{2d}$ (respectively $\text{min}_i |\phi_2^{\top}R_i| \ge \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{2d}$). 
%Denote this event by $\Ephione$ (respectively $\Ephitwo$).
The performance of the algorithm is guaranteed by the following theorem.
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:Modefficiency}
Let 
 \[ 
 Q=  
 %\frac{32\sqrt{2}d^5\kappa^{3/2}_{\max}A^6_{(2,\max)}}{\pi^{5/2}\kappa_{\min}A^4_{(2,\min)}} \sqrt{\hat{\xi}}.
 \frac{4L_u^2A^6_{(2,\max)}}{l_l^4 A^6_{(2,\min)}}\left(\hat{\xi}
 +
 P\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}L_u}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\min}(A)\kappa_{\min}^{1/2}C_1}\right)\right).
 \] 
 Assume the following conditions hold:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \vspace{-3mm}
 \item $\hat{T}$ has distinct eigenvalues;
 \item $\gamma_R > 4 \frac{\sigma_{\max}^2(A)}{\sigma_{\min}(A) }Q$; 
 \item $\min_{i,j:i\neq j} \|A_i - A_j\|_2 > \frac{8}{\gamma_R}\frac{\sigma_{\max}^2(A)}{\sigma_{\min}(A) } Q$;
 \item $\xi \le \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\kappa_{\min}A^2_{(2,\min)}\sigma_{\min}^2(A)}{6\sqrt{2}d^6A_{(2,\max)}^2A_{\max}^2}$
 \item $P(L_u) \le \frac{\sqrt{\pi}\ell^2\kappa_{\min}A^2_{(2,\min)}\sigma_{\min}^2(A)}{6\sqrt{2}d}$
 (so $\bar{\xi} \le 1/3$);
 \item $\hat{\xi}
  +
  P\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}L_u}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\min}(A)\kappa_{\min}^{1/2}C_1}\right) \le \frac{l_l^2 A^2_{(2,\min)}}{2A^2_{(2,\max)}}$.
 \end{enumerate}
 \vspace{-2mm}
Then on the event $\Epsi \cap\Ephi$, there exists a permutation $\pi$ and constants $\{c_1,\ldots,c_d\}$, such that for $1\le k\le d$,
\[
%\|c_k\hat{R}_{\pi(k)} - (R^*R)_k\|_2 \le \frac{4}{\gamma_R} \|\hat{T} - T\|_2\,,
\| c_k\hat{A}_{\pi(k)} - A_k\|_2 \le \frac{4\sigma^2_{\max}(A)}{\gamma_R\sigma_{\min}(A)} Q,
\]
where $\hat{A}$ is the output of the DICA algorithm.
\end{thm}
\begin{remark}
Note that all the conditions of Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency} will be satisfied with probability 1 if $\xi$, $P(L_u)$, and $P\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}L_u}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\min}(A)\kappa_{\min}^{1/2}C_1}\right)$  are small enough.

Similarly, the result of Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency} essentially depends on $\gamma_R$. 
The main concern about Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency} would be the behavior of this quantity. 
Even though an analytic characterization of $\gamma_R$ is not yet known, a probabilistic lower bound for $\gamma_R$ can be developed (recall such lower bound is not available for $\gamma_A$) as shown in Section~\ref{subsec:gammaR}.
Another two concerns would be: (1)When will these conditions hold? In particular, will these conditions hold in the traditional stochastic setting? (2)What is the probability of these events?
We show that the answers to these questions are positive in Section \ref{subsec:gammaR} and \ref{subsec:ThminStocSetting}, which makes Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency} meaningful. \qed
\end{remark}
\subsection{Behavior of $\gamma_R$}
\label{subsec:gammaR}
Note that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are independently sampled from standard Gaussian distribution. 
Thus, $\{\phi_1^{\top}R_1, \cdots, \phi_1^{\top}R_d,$ $\phi_2^{\top}R_1, \cdots, \phi_2^{\top}R_d\}$ are $2d$ independent standard Gaussian random variables. 
Let $Z_i = \frac{\phi_1^{\top}R_i}{\phi_2^{\top}R_i}$. Therefore, $Z_i$, $1\le i\le d$ are $d$ independent Cauchy$(0,1)$ random variables. 

Moreover for any $1\le i, j \le d$, to analyze $\left\vert Z_i^2 - Z_j^2\right\vert
$, WLOG assume both $Z_i$ and $Z_j$ are positive. Then, 
\begin{align*}
\gamma_R =	& \min_{i\neq j} \left\vert Z_i^2 - Z_j^2 \right\vert \\
	=		& \min_{i\neq j}\left\vert Z_i - Z_i \right\vert	\left\vert Z_i + Z_i \right\vert \\
	\ge 	& 2\min_i\vert Z_i\vert\min_{i\neq j} \left\vert Z_i - Z_j \right\vert.
\end{align*}
%Recall that on the event $\Ephione$, $\min_i\vert Z_i \vert \ge \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{2d}$. 
Here $\min_{i\neq j} \left\vert Z_i - Z_j \right\vert$ is the minimal spacing of Cauchy random variables.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ConstantProb}
With Probability at least $1-\delta$ , the following inequalities holds simultaneously.
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item $\min_i |\psi^{\top}A_i| \ge \frac{\sqrt{\pi}A_{(2,\min)}}{5\sqrt{2}(d+1)} \delta$;
\item $\min_i \{|\phi_2^{\top}R_i|\} \ge \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{5\sqrt{2}(d+1)}\delta$;
\item $\|\phi_1\|_2, \|\phi_2\|_2 \le \sqrt{2}\left(\sqrt{\log(\frac{5}{\delta})}+\sqrt{d}\right)$;
\item $\gamma_R \ge\frac{\pi^2}{100d^2(d+1)^2}\delta^2$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{lemma}
Denote that above event by $\E$.
\begin{remark}
Note that all the constants in Lemma~\ref{lem:ConstantProb} are polynomial in $d$ (or $d^{-1}$ for the lower bound), thus the result of Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency} is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\delta}$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. \qed
\end{remark}
\subsection{Further discussion of Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency}}
 \label{subsec:ThminStocSetting}
The other concern of Theorem~\ref{thm:Modefficiency} is the validness of its conditions in the traditional stochastic setting. 
Note that the first condition holds with probability 1. 
The other 5 conditions can be satisfied by small enough 
$\hat{\xi}$, small enough $\bar{\xi}$, small enough $P(L_u)$, and small enough $P\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}L_u}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\min}(A)\kappa_{\min}^{1/2}C_1}\right)$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:denoise}, $P(L_u)$ and $P\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}L_u}{\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\min}(A)\kappa_{\min}^{1/2}C_1}\right)$ can be arbitrarily small given large enough sample size 
\[T = \text{Poly}(d.\frac{1}{\kappa_{\min}}, \frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}(A)}, \frac{1}{\ell}, L_u, L, C, \sigma_{\max}(A)).\] 
$\hat{\xi}$ and $\bar{\xi}$ will be small if $\xi$ is small enough.
Recall Equation \eqref{eq:xi} that 
\[\xi = \left( 6C^2D_2(\mu, \nu_T) + D_4(\mu, \nu_T)\right) \le 7C^2D_4(\mu, \nu_T),\]
where $C$ is an upper bound for the signal function $s$.
%\[\xi = \text{Poly}(\frac{1}{L_u}, \frac{\sigma_{\min}(A)}{\sigma_{\max}(A)}, \ell, \gamma_R, \frac{1}{\sigma_{\max}(A)},\frac{1}{d}, \kappa_{\min}\sigma_{\min}^4(A)).\] 
Moreover, on the event $\E$, all constants $1/\ell_l$, $L_u$ and $\gamma_R$ are upper bounded in polynomial of $\{ 1/\sigma_{\min}, 1/\delta, d\}$. 

In Summary, we have the final result, as follows.
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:finalRes}
 Given a large enough $T$, if there exists a product measure $\mu$  such that  $D_4(\mu, \nu_T)$ is small enough satisfying
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item $T \ge \text{Poly}(d, \frac{1}{\kappa_{\min}}, \frac{1}{\delta}, L, C, \sigma_{\max}(A), \frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}(A)})$;
\item $D_4(\mu, \nu_T) \le \text{Poly}(\frac{1}{C},  \sigma_{\min}(A),  \frac{1}{\sigma_{\max}(A)},\frac{1}{d}, \delta, \kappa_{\min})$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
Then with probability at least $1-\delta$, there exists a permutation $\pi$ and constants $\{c_1,\ldots,c_d\}$, such that for $1\le k\le d$,
\[
\| c_k\hat{A}_{\pi(k)} - A_k\|_2 \le \mathcal{C}\left(D_4(\mu, \nu_T)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\right),
\]
where $\mathcal{C} = \text{Poly}(\sigma_{\max}, 1/\sigma_{\min}, 1/\kappa_{\min},1/\delta, d, C, L)$, and $\hat{A}$ is the output of the DICA algorithm.

In particular, in the traditional stochastic setting given large enough $T$ (but still polynomial in all the parameters, as specified in the Appendix),
 with probability at most $1-\delta$, 
 DICA will generate an estimation $\hat{A}$ of the mixing matrix $A$ in
 time complexity of $O(d^3T)$, 
 such that there exists a permutation $\pi$ and constants $\{c_1,\ldots,c_d\}$, such that for $1\le k\le d$,
\begin{align*}
& \| c_k\hat{A}_{\pi(k)} - A_k\|_2 \le \\
& \quad\frac{\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\sqrt{2T}}\text{Poly}(C, \sigma_{\max}, \frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}}, \frac{1}{\kappa_{\min}},\frac{1}{\delta}, d).
\end{align*}
\end{thm}
\begin{remark}
Note that the result is polynomial in $1/\delta$ which is weaker than being polynomial in $\log(1/\delta)$. \qed
\end{remark}
\begin{cor}
\label{cor:signalerror}
 Given a large enough $T$, if there exists a product measure $\mu$  such that  $D_4(\mu, \nu_T)$ is small enough satisfying
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item $T \ge \text{Poly}(d, \frac{1}{\kappa_{\min}}, \frac{1}{\delta}, L, C, \sigma_{\max}(A), \frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}(A)})$;
\item $D_4(\mu, \nu_T) \le \text{Poly}(\frac{1}{C},  \sigma_{\min}(A),  \frac{1}{\sigma_{\max}(A)},\frac{1}{d}, \delta, \kappa_{\min})$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
Then with probability at least $1-\delta$, there exists a permutation $\pi$ and constants $\{c_1,\ldots,c_d\}$, such that for $1\le k\le d$,
\begin{align*}
\| \hat{s}_{\pi(k)} - s \|_2 & \le \mathcal{C}(\|s\|_2+\frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}(A)}\|\eps\|_2)(D_4(\mu,\nu_T)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}) \\
& \quad +\frac{\|\eps\|_2}{\sigma_{\min}(A)},
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal{C} = \text{Poly}(\sigma_{\max}, 1/\sigma_{\min}, 1/\kappa_{\min},1/\delta, d, C, L)$.

In particular, in the traditional stochastic setting given large enough $T$ (but still polynomial in all the parameters, as specified in the Appendix),
 with probability at most $1-\delta$, 
 DICA will generate an estimation $\hat{A}$ of the mixing matrix $A$ in
 time complexity of $O(d^3T)$,

\begin{align*}

& \quad\frac{\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\sqrt{2T}}(\|s\|_2+\frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}(A)}\|\eps\|_2)\text{Poly} +\frac{\|\eps\|_2}{\sigma_{\min}(A)},
\end{align*}
where $\text{Poly}$ is a polynomial in $(C, \sigma_{\max}, \frac{1}{\sigma_{\min}}, \frac{1}{\kappa_{\min}},\frac{1}{\delta}, d)$.
\end{cor}

\subsection{A modified version of DICA}
\label{subsec:modifiedDICA}
We would expect that DICA will achieve smaller error in the case of extreme coherence, since $1/\gamma_A$ will be much larger than $1/\gamma_R$. 
However, the experimental results show the opposite, as in Section \ref{subsubsec:results}.  
The reason is when the coherence is extremely high, the estimation error of $M$ in DICA is so much larger than that in HKICA that it dominates the error caused by coherence of the mixing matrix.
This estimation error comes from taking the inverse of $T_2$ in DICA. 
We are not yet clear about the relation of the estimation error and the coherence of the mixing matrix.

We propose the following ICA algorithm, Algorithm \ref{alg:DICA_Mod}, trying to relieve the estimation error problem of DICA, but still keeps large gap of the eigenvalues in the eigen-decomposition. 
\begin{algorithm} 
\caption{DICA Modified (DICA\_Mod)}
\label{alg:DICA_Mod}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\INPUT $x(t)$ for $1\le t \le T$. 
\OUTPUT An estimation of the mixing matrix $A$. 
\STATE Sample $\psi$ from a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution;
\STATE Evaluate $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi)$, \\
%\quad where $\hat{m_p}(\eta) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^{T} (\eta^{\top}g(k))^p$, and $\hat{f}(\eta) = \frac{1}{12}\big(\hat{m_4}(\eta) - 3\hat{m_2}(\eta)^2 \big)$;
\STATE Compute $\hat{B}$ such that $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi) = \hat{B}\hat{B}^{\top}$;
\STATE Sample $\phi$ from the standard normal distribution;
\STATE Compute $\hat{T} = \hat{G}(\hat{B}^{-\top}\phi)$;
\STATE Compute all the eigenvectors of $\hat{M} = \hat{B}^{-1}\hat{T}\hat{B}^{-\top}$, $\hat{R} = \{\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d\}$;
\STATE Return $\hat{A} = \hat{B}\hat{R}$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{remark}
Note that the eigenvalues of $\hat{M}$ in DICA\_Mod are $\frac{(\phi^{\top}R_i)^2}{(\psi^{\top}A_i)^4\kappa_i}$ for $1\le i\le d$. 
When $A$ is highly coherent, we would expect that $\psi^{\top}A_i$'s are close to each other. Also, the $\kappa_i$'s are fixed. 
Given that $\phi^{\top}R_i$'s are far separated from each other, we would intuitively expect the eigenvalues are well separated from each other. 
However, we don't have a rigorous proof for this algorithm.
Experimental results shows that DICA\_Mod consistently performs better than DICA. \qed
\end{remark}

\subsection{Recursive versions}
Recently \citet{vempala2014max} proposed a recursion idea to improve the sample complexity of the Fourier PCA algorithm \citep{goyal2014fourier}. 
Instead of recovering all the columns of $A$ in one eigen-decomposition, the recursive algorithm only decomposes the whole space into only two sub-spaces according to the maximal spacing of the eigenvalues, 
then recursively decompose each subspaces until it is 1-dimensional.
The insight of this recursive procedure is when the maximal spacing of the eigenvalues are much large than  the minimal one (e.g. improve from $\frac{\delta}{d^2}$ to $\frac{\delta}{\log d}$), then even the error may accumulated in the recursion, overall we still have better results. 
However, this algorithm is based on the assumption that the mixing matrix is orthonormal, so that the projection to its subspaces can always eliminate some component of the source signals. 

We adapt the above idea to our algorithms. Due to space limit, we will only take the simplest recursive algorithm, recursive version of HKICA, as an example.

To force a orthonormal mixing matrix, we will first compute the square root matrix $B$ of  $\nabla^2f(\psi) = AD_{\psi}KA^{\top}$. 
Thus $B = AD_{\psi}^{1/2}K^{1/2}R^{\top}$ for some orthonormal matrix $R$. 
Transform our observation by $B^{-1}$, we then have the new observation $y(t) = B^{-1}x(t) + B^{-1}\eps(t) = RD_{\psi}^{1/2}K^{1/2}s(t) + B^{-1}\eps(t)$. 
Note that $B^{-1}\eps(t)$ is still a Gaussian noise. Also $D_{\psi}^{1/2}K^{1/2}$ is diagonal, thus $RD_{\psi}^{1/2}K^{1/2}s(t)$ is an orthonormal mixture of independent sources.
We then apply the recursive algorithm to recover the mixing matrix $R$. Finally, $BR$ gives an estimation of $A$ up to scaling.

To recover $R$ using recursive matrix, we follow the idea of HKICA (and DICA) to compute two Hessian matrices $T_1 = RD_{\psi}^{-1}\Lambda_1R^{\top}$ and $T_2 = RD_{\psi}^{-1}\Lambda_2R^{\top}$. 
Then instead of computing the eigen-decomposition of $T = T_1/T_2$ (as in HKICA), we only decompose its eigen-space into two subspaces, according to the maximal spacing of the eigenvalues of $T$. 
The `Recur' helper takes a projection matrix $P$ of a subspace spanned by some columns of $R$ (WLOG we assume it is the first $k$ columns of $R$). After the calculation $T$, we project $T$ by $M = P^{\top}TP$. Thus $PMP^{\top}$ only consists the eigen-space defined by $P$. 
Lastly by separating the eigenvectors of $M$ according to its eigenvalues into $PP_1$ and $PP_2$, the `Recur' helper decompose the subspaces into two smaller subspaces.  

\begin{algorithm} 
\caption{recursive version of HKICA (HKICA\_recur)}
\label{alg:HKICA_recur}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\INPUT $x(t)$ for $1\le t \le T$. 
\OUTPUT An estimation of the mixing matrix $A$. 
\STATE Sample $\psi$ from a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution;
\STATE Evaluate $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi) = \hat{G}(\psi)$; \\
\STATE Compute $\hat{B}$ such that $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\psi) = \hat{B}\hat{B}^{\top}$;
\STATE Compute $\hat{y}(t) = \hat{B}^{-1}x(t)$ for $1\le t \le T$;
\STATE Let $P = I_d$;
\STATE Compute $\hat{R} = \text{Recur}(\hat{y}, P)$;
\STATE Return $\hat{B}\hat{R}$;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{algorithm} 
\caption{The `Recur' Helper}
\label{alg:recur}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\INPUT $x(t)$ for $1\le t \le T$, a projection matrix $P\in \R^{d\times k}$ ($d\ge k$). 
\OUTPUT An estimation of the mixing matrix $A\in \R^{d\times k}$. 

\STATE if $k==1$, Return $P$;
\STATE Sample $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ independently from a standard Gaussian distribution of dimension $d$;
\STATE Evaluate $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\phi_1)$ and $\nabla^2\hat{f}(\phi_2)$, 
\STATE Compute $\hat{T} = (\nabla^2 \hat{f}(\phi_1))(\nabla^2\hat{f}(\phi_2))^{-1}$;
\STATE Compute $\hat{M} = P^{\top} \hat{T} P$;
\STATE Compute all the eigen-decomposition of $\hat{M}$, its eigenvalues$\{\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_d\}$ where $\sigma_1\ge\ldots\ge \sigma_k$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $\{\mu_1,\ldots, \mu_k\}$;
\STATE Find the index $m = \arg\max \sigma_m - \sigma_{m+1}$; 
\STATE Let $P_1 = (\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_m)$, and $P_2 = (\mu_{m+1},\ldots,\mu_k)$;
\STATE Compute $W_1 = \text{Recur} (x, PP_1)$, and  $W_2 = \text{Recur} (x, PP_2)$;
\STATE Return $[W_1,W_2]$;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{remark}
Other algorithms can be modified into a recursive version in a similar way, based on the idea of mapping the estimated Hessian matrix into a small subspace by $M = P^{\top}TP$. 
\qed
\end{remark}
\begin{thm}
\label{thm:recursiveAlg}
Given the conditions in Theorem~\ref{thm:finalRes}, with probability at least $1-\delta$, the recursive version of HKICA returns the mixing matrix with a guaranteed polynomial error bound.
\end{thm} 
\begin{remark}
The recursion idea improves the sample complexity of the eigen-decomposition (to recover the orthonormal mixing matrix $R$). However, the error carried from quasi-whitening dominates the total error. 
\end{remark}
\if0
\begin{remark}
In our result, the recursive version gets worse error bound, compared to the one-pass version. The reason is that the events $\Ephi$ and $\Ez$ could be required to hold for $d$ times. Therefore, for the final result to hold for probability at least $1-\delta$, the error bound for each recursion has to hold with probability at least $1-\frac{1}{d}\delta$. 

Recall that in our case we have lower bound for the minimal eigenvalue spacing as $O(\frac{1}{d^2}\delta)$, and lower bound for maximal eigenvalue spacing as $O(\frac{1}{d}\delta)$. By requiring it holds for higher probability ($1-\frac{1}{d}\delta$), the maximal gap actually reduced to $O(\frac{1}{d^2}\delta)$, same order as the one-pass version, leading to the same error bound.

Moreover, for the event $E\phi$, the recursive version essentially require the lower bound $\ell$ is $d$ times smaller than the one-pass version, which cause high degrees of $d$ in the error bound.

For the recursive version to help, one possible way is to prove that for each recursion, we only require the conclusion holds with probability at least $1-\frac{1}{\log d}\delta$, rather than $1-\frac{1}{d}\delta$. 
Another potential improvement is developing a lower bound for the maximal spacing that is sub-polynomial in $d$, e.g. $\frac{1}{\log d}\delta$, and sub-polynomial dependence of $\delta$ in the lower bound in the Event $\Ephi$, e.g. $\frac{1}{\log \frac{1}{\delta}}$.    
\qed
\end{remark}

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:ExpRes}
We compare the empirical performances of several ICA algorithms in this section. 
\subsection{Comparison of $\gamma_A$ and $\gamma_R$}
\label{subsec:comparisonGamma}
Even though theoretical result for $\gamma_A$ is not available, we compare its behavior and that of $\gamma_R$ empirically. 
In this section, we test the expected values of $1/\gamma_A$ and $1/\gamma_R$ for mixing matrices $A$ with different coherences.
In particular, we artificially construct 4 kinds of matrices, as follows:
Given $v_b$ and the matrix $P$ both are generated from standard normal distribution (with different dimensions).
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item $A_1 = P$;
\item $A_2 = v_b\times\boldsymbol{1}' + 0.3\times P$;
\item $A_3 = v_b\times\boldsymbol{1}' + 0.05\times P$;
\item $A_4 = v_b\times\boldsymbol{1}' + 0.005\times P$.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
Another orthonormal matrix R is generated by computing the left column space of a non-singular random matrix (from standard normal distribution).  

For each of the matrices, we generate $\phi$ and $\psi$ from standard normal distribution for 3 times, and pick the minimal values (corresponding to the largest $\gamma_A$ and $\gamma_R$).
We run 200 repetitions and take the average of each $1/\gamma$. The logarithm of the average is reported in Figure \ref{fig:miniSpacing}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:miniSpacing}
\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{miniSpacing}
\caption{The values of $\gamma$ for matrices with different coherences}
\end{figure}

As expected, the value of gamma increases as the coherence of the matrix. 
But on the other hand, the distinction from that of an orthonormal matrix only happens when $A$ is highly coherence. 

\subsection{Reconstruction errors}
We then investigate the performances of different ICA algorithms in a simulation setting, with mixing matrices of different coherences. 

\subsection{Settings}
In particular, 6 algorithms are tested: 
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item Re-sampling version of  HKICA (HKICA\_Re);
\item Symmetrizing version of  HKICA  (HKICA\_Sym);
\item Re-sampling version of DICA  (DICA\_Re);
\item Symmetrizing version of  DICA  (DICA\_Sym);
\item A intermediate version of  DICA  (DICA\_Int);
\item The default FastICA algorithm in the 'ITE' toolbox \citep{szabo12separation} (FICA). 
\item  Randomly guessing (Random).
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
Recall that the re-sampling version and the symmetrizing version are two different ways for the algorithms to deal with complex (invalid) output, as discussed in Remark \ref{rmk:symmetrization}.
FastICA, as one of the most popular ICA algorithm in the literature, is evaluated and reported as a base line. 
%We will discuss the intuition of the DICA\_Int algorithm later. 
The last algorithm is randomly guessing, serving as another baseline.
We do not test the algorithm of \citep{anandkumar2012tensordecomposition} because the tensor decomposition takes too long to converge and achieve a valid solution. 

In the simulation, a common mixing matrix $A$ of dimension 6 is generated in a same way as described in Section \ref{subsec:comparisonGamma}. 
Then we generate a $6$-dimensional BPSK signal $s$, as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
\item Let period$=[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{5},\sqrt{7},\sqrt{11},\sqrt{13},\sqrt{19}]$;
\item For the $i$th component, we generate a binary sequence $queue$ uniformly;
\item For the time step $t$, $s_i(t) = i\times\sin (\text{period}(i)*t)$ if $queue(i) = 0$ and $s_i(t) = -i\times\sin (\text{period}(i)*t)$ otherwise;
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-1mm}  
In order to have the components of $s$ are close to independent, we need the ratio of their frequencies are irrational. 
Lastly, the observed signal is generated by $x = As+c\epsilon$ where $\epsilon$ is noise generated from a $d$-dimensional normal distribution with randomly generated covariance. 
We take $20000$ instances of the observed signal on time step $t= 1,\ldots, 20000$.
We test the noise ratio $c$ from 0(noiseless) to 1(heavily noisy). 
All the algorithms are evaluated on a $200$ repetitions. For each repetition, we try $3$ times and report the best.

We measure the performances of the algorithms by its actual reconstruction error.
In particular, we evaluate the following quantity between the true mixing matrix $A$ and the one returned by the algorithms $\hat{A}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:parerror}
\min_{\Pi,S} \|\hat{A}\Pi S - A\|_{\text{Frob}},
\end{equation}
where $\Pi$ is a permutation matrix, and $S$ is a column scaling matrix (diagonal).
The calculation of this measure would require a exhaust search for the optimal permutation.
\if0
The second measure we used is an approximation of Equation \eqref{equ:parerror} proposed by \citet{comon1994independent}. 
Note that to evaluate Equation \eqref{equ:parerror} one has to enumerate all the permutation $\Pi$, which is not affordable in practice for a large dimension $d$. 
This error helps avoid this computation problem. 

The last measure is the mutual information between the joint distribution of the recovered sources and the product of its marginal ones. 
This measure is common in practice when the true mixing matrix $A$ is unknown. 
In fact, this measure can be reduced to the sum of the entropies of its marginal distribution \citep{Learned-Miller:2003:IUS:945365.964306}. 
In particular for an output $\hat{A}$, we evaluate the following quantity:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i = 1}^{d} \text{Entropy}(\hat{x_i}) + \log |\hat{A}|,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{x} = \hat{A}^{-1}y$, and $|\hat{A}|$ is the absolute value of the determine of $\hat{A}$. We also use the entropy estimation function 'HShannon\_kNN\_k\_estimation' in the 'ITE' toolbox \citep{szabo14information}. 
\fi

\subsubsection{Results}
\label{subsubsec:results}
We report the reconstruction errors for different kinds of mixing matrices and noise ratios.

\begin{figure*}[pt]
\label{fig:Error}
\centering
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{error2}
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{error3}
	\includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{error4}
\caption{Reconstruction Error}
\end{figure*}

Algorithms in the symmetrizing version are consistently outperformed by their re-sampling version, as expected. 
%We don't include the running time of both versions here, since it is straightforward that the symmetrizing version will take less time because of fewer iterations. 
Moreover, the experimental results suggests that moment methods are more robust to high-coherence mixing matrix and Gaussian noise.
FastICA achieve best performance in the case of low coherence.
As the increase of the coherence of the mixing matrix, its performance decreases quickly and becomes sensitive to noise.
On the other hand, moment methods seems much more stable with respect to coherence and noise.

We are expecting that the performance of these algorithms will decrease for high coherence case. 
This is confirmed by the experiments. 
We are also expecting that DICA\_Re will achieve smaller error in the case of extreme coherence, since $1/\gamma_A$ will be much larger than $1/\gamma_R$. 
However, the experimental results indicate the opposite. 
The reason is when the coherence is extremely high, the estimation error of $M$ in DICA is so much larger than that in HKICA, which is caused by taking the inverse of $T_2$ in DICA, that it overwhelms the error caused by coherence of the mixing matrix.
We are not yet clear about the relation of the estimation error and the coherence of the mixing matrix.

In summary, the results suggest these moment methods are comparable to each other in practice,
while FastICA  is better for the case of low coherence case or mild coherence with low noise.
If the observations have heavy noise and the mixing matrix is not the case of extremely coherent, then HKICA may be the best choice.
In the case of extremely coherent mixing matrix, DICA\_Mod performs better.




\if0 
We would conjecture that if the sample size is extremely large and the mixing matrix is extremely coherent, then DICA (or DICA\_Mod) would outperforms HKICA significantly.
