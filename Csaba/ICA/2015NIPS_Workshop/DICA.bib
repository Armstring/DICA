	Abstract = {We study independent component analysis with noisy observations. 
We present, for the first time in the literature, consistent, polynomial-time algorithms to recover non-Gaussian source signals and the mixing matrix with 
a reconstruction error that vanishes at a rate of T^{1/2} using T observations and scales only polynomially with
the natural parameters of the problem. 
Our algorithms and analysis also extend to deterministic source signals whose empirical distributions are approximately independent.
